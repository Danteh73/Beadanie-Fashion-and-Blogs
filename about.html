            <p>
                MEET THE CEO. Hi, my name is Daniel Kariuki most people call me Aj
                I’m a graduate at Technical University of Kenya I perused Bachelor <br>
                of Business Information Technology, 23yrs, Father of One Son and married<br>
                 to one wife Beatrice Wanjiku. I was born in Kenya I am entrepreneur who has <br>
                 always believed that working an 8-4 job isn`t the best way to live life. <br>
                 After observing so many individuals follow the usual path of making a living.<br>
	            I realized they were missing out on what life truly has to offer.<br>
              So, I decided to change that and create wealth through something I had passion for, <br>
                and that’s when I discovered fashion and Blog business   which I saw as a big gap in the market
